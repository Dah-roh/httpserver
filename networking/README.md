NETWORK is group of computers connected together.

# TCP/IP Network layers

- Application (http or ftp or smtp)
- Transport (TCP or UDP; add headers and port which specifies/identifies the process)
- Internet (IP which identifies the destination and source network using ip addresses)
- Network Interface

### TCP/IP provides two transport layer protocols

- TCP (Transmision control protocol)
- UDP (user datagram protocl)

TCP keeps track of what has been sent and what has not been sent by transmission and acknowledgement

UDP packets may be sent out of order. And some data may be lost
